Place the profile image here as `sateesh.jpg` (JPEG or PNG).

You can copy the image you provided into this folder with the filename `sateesh.jpg` so the About page will import it.

Example (PowerShell):

```powershell
# from the directory where the image is located
Copy-Item .\my-image.jpg "C:\Sateesh\Projects\PersonalPortfolio\Portfolio\src\assets\sateesh.jpg"
```

After adding the image, the About page will use it automatically.
